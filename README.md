Hey there. I'm Imani and I am new to the world of code. <br>
I am very excited to start my journey as a front end web developer. 
Currently, I am learning HTML and CSS and then afterwards, JavaScript.
Outside of coding, I am a writer and photographer. 
You can follow my blog here: https://imanidevelops.hashnode.dev/
